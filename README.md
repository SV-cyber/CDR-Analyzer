# 📊 CDR Analyzer Tool

The **CDR Analyzer Tool** is a professional forensic software application developed to assist **cybercrime investigators, digital forensic analysts, and law enforcement** in analyzing **Call Detail Records (CDRs)**.  
It enables investigators to quickly detect suspects, map geolocations, visualize communication timelines, and generate **court-admissible PDF reports**.

This project was built during my internship at the **CID Cybercrime Division, Ranchi**, where I worked on real CDR datasets to streamline investigations.

## 🔹 Why CDR Analysis?
- Call Detail Records (CDRs) are a crucial part of **telecom forensics**.  
- Manual CDR analysis is time-consuming and prone to error.  
- This tool automates the process, providing investigators with:  
  - **Actionable intelligence**  
  - **Faster suspect detection**  
  - **Readable reports for legal use**
